INTERFACES

Classes from different inheritance trees can implement the same interface (or multiple interfaces). For example, any class might want to be saveable.

All interface methods are public and abstract (with no bodies).

An interface is a reference type, similar to a class, that can contain only constants, method signatures, default methods, static methods, and nested types. 

Method bodies exist only for default methods and static methods. Interfaces cannot be instantiated, they can only be implemented by classes or extended by other interfaces.

It's as if a parent class defines what you are, but interfaces define the roles you can play.
