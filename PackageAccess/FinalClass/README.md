Taking the public access example, when you add the 'final' keyword to the Wine class declaration you get a compile error:

Exception in thread "main" java.lang.Error: Unresolved compilation problems: 
	The method getColour() is undefined for the type RedWine
	The method getAlcohol() is undefined for the type RedWine
	at Main.main(Main.java:6)
